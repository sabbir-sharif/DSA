  - Any changes in the array inside method will affaect the main Array.

### Day - 02
1. Linear Search
- Go through every element in the array. if found it returns the index. otherwise returns -1.

Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)
---
2. Largest Number
- set a variable with the value -infinite.
- go through the array and compare if the value of the index is greater or not.
- if greater then change the largest value with the index value.
- compare with every index of the array.
- finally return the largest value.
